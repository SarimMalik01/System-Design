# Behavioural Design Patterns

Behavioural Design Patterns focus on how objects communicate with each other, how responsibilities are distributed, and how behavior is organized between objects.

They help in defining clear interaction mechanisms and improving flexibility in object collaboration.

## Patterns Overview

### 1️⃣ Strategy Pattern
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable at runtime.

### 2️⃣ Observer Pattern
Establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified automatically.

### 3️⃣ State Pattern
Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, making it appear as if the object changed its class.

### 4️⃣ Template Method Pattern
Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class while allowing subclasses to redefine specific steps.

### 5️⃣ Visitor Pattern
Separates operations from the object structure, allowing new operations to be added without modifying existing classes.

### 6️⃣ Chain of Responsibility Pattern
Passes a request along a chain of handlers until one of them handles it.

### 7️⃣ Command Pattern
Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization, queuing, logging, and undo/redo functionality.

### 8️⃣ Iterator Pattern
Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

### 9️⃣ Mediator Pattern
Defines an object that centralizes complex communication and control logic between related objects.

### 🔟 Memento Pattern
Captures and restores an object’s internal state without violating encapsulation.
