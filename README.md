A curated repository of **system design diagrams and explanations**, covering:

- High-level architectures  
- Component interactions  
- Data flow  
- Design trade-offs for scalable software systems  

This repo is great for interview preparation, architecture learning, and understanding core principles behind real-world systems. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

##  What This Repo Covers

### 1) System Design Concepts

This repository contains diagrams and explanations for common patterns used in designing scalable systems, including:

- Layered architectures  
- Distributed systems components  
- Service communication patterns  
- Trade-offs in real design scenarios  

It also organizes **design pattern categories** (e.g., behavioural, creational, structural) to help you study and visualize reusable solutions.

## 2) How to Use This Repository

1. **Explore** folders based on design pattern categories  
2. Inside each category, you’ll find diagrams + text explanations  
3. Diagrams help visualize system flow & component interactions  
4. Explanations provide reasoning behind designs and trade-offs

---

## 3) Why It’s Valuable

This repo is helpful for:

- **Interview preparation (system design)**  
- **Learning architecture principles**  
- **Understanding real-world design decisions**  
- **Studying patterns and trade-offs at scale**

Each pattern and architecture is explained with clarity to make complex designs easy to understand.

## 4) Categories Included

### a) Behavioural

Focuses on the communication between objects and how responsibilities are distributed.

### b) Creational

Explains patterns for creating objects and managing their lifecycle (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype).

### c) Structural

Shows how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.
